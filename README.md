# Occupancy Detection suing Machine-Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the ML models to detect occupancy in a room by analysing parameters such as Temperature,Humidity,etc,.The testing accuracy of the models is greated than ***97%***.

## Modules Used
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pickel

## Algorithms Used
- KNN
- Random Forest Classifier
- MLP

## Steps to use it
- Download dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+) and extract it in the Dataset folder.
- Run ***Models.py*** 
```
python3 Models.py
```
- Models will be trained and saved as ***.sav*** extension.
